	<p>hey hello </p>

	<p2>today we learned how to inspect and use the console feature. we learned how to use the keypress, click, and mousemove functions and how they affect the console. </p>

	<p>hi journal! my original idea for my jumpscare was to make a website where you click on a pumpkin to make it grow but then add in a jump scare at a random click. i was able to figure out how to add in the jumpscare but not at any random click. as of right now, the jumpscare happens everytime on the 5th click. </p>

	<p2>I just finished my gratitude card for my parents for thanksgiving. I made it so hearts appear on every click and also added a video icon that links to a video with my mom. On the top right I also included a photo gallery icon that links to a page with photos of my dad and me!</p>
